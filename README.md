 fractals R cool ðŸ˜Ž

just picked up the fractal geometry of nature, and i got annoyed i couldn't play w em myself
so here's me tryna make some standard fractals (and variations!) using python's turtle module!!

honestly, this would been kinda awesome if it you could directly fiddle w the parameters & see the updated fractal in real time
possible project for a future atharva ig??
